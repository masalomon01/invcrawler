18,0,Vectors Behaving Badly in Studio,"So I'm trying to copy and paste some vector artwork, logos, into Studio and am running into issues. Upon pasting, Studio seems to develop a mind of it's own in terms of how it interprets the vector data and things come out looking super wonky. The top image is what happens when copy/pasting from Illustrator where the bottom is from Sketch - top is pretty obviously wrong, bottom is closer to normal but has some weird things happening in and around the middle of the F, O, and N. It's not just this logo, either, it's happening with a few other logos (but not all) that I'm working with. I looked at your Studio ""getting started"" article on the subject of importing content and saw toward that bottom that it recommends saving vector artwork from other apps as an SVG and importing that file. The problem with this ""solution"" is that I can't import SVGs into Studio via the ""Image"" tool... they are greyed out in the import dialog box. Any thoughts? Edit*I tried importing using the File>Import option and get similar results as the Illustrator image posted above.",Chris Randalls,https://support.invisionapp.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360003143491-Vectors-Behaving-Badly-in-Studio,4,2018-04-03T01:03:14Z,1,1

I see you can nest components within components so I was questioning if that was my solution, but as it stands I'm not able to get anything workable save having a different button state on a separate artboard and performing state changes on the component between them.  Is this functionality currently available and if not is it forthcoming?

I found this thread and hoped that I had an answer to my problem, but I was left with a pretty bad taste in my mouth. Not being able export assets that are nested inside of symbols is an incredible oversight on your design and engineering teams part. To put it lightly, I'm disappointed that this is even an issue since it means that I'll have to go against best practices just to make sure that our developers can access assets in an intuitive way. I'm shocked that this was brought up as an issue 6 months ago and it still hasn't been addressed. Let's be real here for a minute. Users shouldn't have to hack around this limitation with your technology.

When applying the hotspot template to the 1x page, the hotspots were blown out of proportion. BUT then when going back to the 2x page where the hotspots were previously fine, they are now broken just like the 1x pages.

170,0,Problem with Overlays,"Hi folks,So we've created a series of screens that we want drop-down menus to appear on as overlays. They worked fine when we had everything in one section, and if I go into the hotspot builder on any of the screens I'm using, it shows them as being where I placed them. But when I share out the specific screens, the hotspots all vanish. The one around my logo leading back to the ""home page"" remains, but the drop-downs are all gone. I moved the drop-downs to a new section to keep them organized and not wind up with them shared to a client.

192,1,How exactly is syncing of text styles and colors working in Craft's library plugin,"It is really hard to find out how the syncing in Craft's library is supposed to work. Syncing symbols is working as one would expect. You push your change back to the library, the library gets updated and in the connected documents all symbols also get updated. When it comes to colors and text styles, the pushed changes get updated in the library, but these changes are not reflected in the connected documents. If this is the way it is supposed to work, its almost useless for collaboration.  If not, what am I doing wrong? I realized since the latest versions of Sketch (4.9 - 4.9.1) the ""Generate Styles"" in the ""Document"" tap is not working properly anymore. It's only generating one broken text style and skips the rest. Is anybody experiencing similar problems?Do I have to generate a style page to sync properly text styles and colors?

203,1,Is Craft Sync becoming more trouble than it is worth for you too?,"Don't get me wrong, when Craft Sync all goes smoothly syncing a large complex proto with many screens is a time saver..........But it all falls apart when you pick up a file you didn't create. Syncing can't move between Sketch and PS. :-(Lets say UX-er 'A' creates a full working Sketch Ruby demo and it is approved, all ok so far... Then say Designer 'B' picks up that sketch ruby wireframe demo to style the elements and then is unable to open the file because we are not allowed to run sketch in-house instead the designer has to resort to trying to manage and update hotspots in that template via differing software, say PS CC17 with craft sync. Do not try this. This can be a nightmare. I am finding the old flow of exporting screens as PNGs and dragging em in is way more robust to share wireframes and that I would recommend to the community to never jump out of one software to the other with craft sync.  Also it is such a shame that the constant craft plugin updates often break the complex syncing too. I hope Invision team understand firewalls inside companies are only going to increase security and the limitations on syncing via craft smoothly even if ports are unblocked by your IT dept.

254,1,"""Sync Styles"" adds non-existing colors to Sketch document","So I've run into this issue on two separate projects. When syncing with the ""Sync Styles"" button of the plugin, Craft will sometimes create/add a new, non-exisiting color to the Styles-page. This new color is always 'related' to an actual color used in the document.For example, one of my colors is #333333, and all of a sudden Craft will create a new color #262626 that doesn't exist anywhere in my designs.I can select the new color and color pick it to the original, re-sync and it will disappear. But one or more sync actions later and it will randomly reappear. I have this issue for multiple colors. And while it's easy to identify and correct the color above, it's a real horror story when the same thing happens to an array of similar tints that are closely related; it effectively becomes impossible to correctly identify the real color and fix the issue. (Pick the wrong color and you'll send your text styles into a tailspin.)I've already cleared all my document swatches, so there's no conflict there.And I'm certain I don't haven't any elements in my document that I've used these colors on. For example: I use #333333 al the time because it's easy to remember and input, but I've never used/typed #262626. And the fact that they randomly return a while later is odd to say the least.In any case, it's a real drag on my projects and add a lot of work to keeping my styles consistent.",Jan Nikolaas Gijsen,https://support.invisionapp.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/115011168166--Sync-Styles-adds-non-existing-colors-to-Sketch-document,27,2017-11-07T10:52:07Z,11,31

333,2,Resources for Designers New to Sketch,"I must confess, I've been an Adobe user for the majority of my design life. Self-taught using every available online resource back in the early 2000's, it took a long time for me to realize just how valuable Sketch could be in my workflow. Somewhat shamefully, I spent over a year with Sketch installed and licensed before I ever brought myself to take the plunge and Switch to Sketch.This said, I know I'm not the only one who did the back-n-forth thing before fully embracing Sketch. So I'm curious - what path did you take in adopting Sketch? What tools and resources did you utilize to become better acclimated to working within Sketch? Let us, and the community know. Who knows, maybe we'll help improve someone else's path to adopting Sketch smoother than our own.- - -Here's a few of my favorite resources:Switch to SketchNothing beats fun and fast!

335,2,If you are struggling with loading artboards/pages from Sketch into InVision via Craft...,"In case you do what I did:DO:  Rename every one of your artboards with a unique name.

If you leave your artboard on seperately named pages and if your artboard on every single page has the same name [such as ""Desktop HD"" or Default] Craft will only ""see"" one artboard and you will find much needless frustration.
